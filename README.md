###General Bioinformatics Module
This is a general bioinformatics Python module in progress. Whilst all core functions should work as intended, they are not neccessarily optimised. Redevelopment to resolve this is ongoing but irregular. Biocore currently supports both Python 2 & 3, it is my intention to maintain this compatibility throughout development.

####biocore.py
Completed miscellaneous functions, most non-specialised functions should be found here.

####biostats.py
Functions of statistical importance, this script is primarily intended to return overview statistics for newly assembled genomes but will later be adapted for more general evaluation.

####Additional .py files
Any functions additional to those listed above should be considered as being under active development, they may therefore produce unexpected/unintended results. Use these with additional caution.

####Acknowledgements
Thanks to Álvaro Abella Bascarán for his proposed style changes.
